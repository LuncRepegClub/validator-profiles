We have a passion for technology. In 2013, we started off creating and producing large scale festivals throughout America. In fact, to date, we have amassed an events ecosystem of over 250,000 annual foodies and outdoor enthusiast. In 2018, our love for technology led us to begin building a contactless wristband payment wallet on the Stellar blockchain for our festival and event ecosystems. Over the years, we have successfully partnered with the likes of the Chicago Cubs, and as of October 2022, voted one of America’s top food truck festivals. 

Our focus is utility and the integration of multi blockchain technology to real world ecosystems.

Our company has been building on the **blockchain** for over 4 years. Specifically, with an emphasis on digital payments and events integration. We started as festival creators & producers and our passions has lead us to also become multi blockchain builders and validators, where our main principles are **utility** and **security**.

Stellar (XLM) blockchain was the first cryptocurrency, we started building with it and learned how to build and provide fast, low cost secure payment applications to customers.

That’s how the **Stellar Payband** brand was born, since Stellar, in our opinion, is one of the digital spaces universal financial payments blockchains and everything related to payments. As we honed our niche for utility we rebranded as **Lux Payband**. We embraced utility. Stellar Lumens, is how much light is emitted from a source. Whereas as Lux is how much light reaches the surface. As our goal being utility is reaching the masses via multi chain utility. 

As this is our core mission, create real world multi chain utility for end users, shining light on the surface. In, further embracing this utility we created **LUX Blockchain Validators** for furthering multi chain validations.
